- Python 3 support

Version 2.1
-----------

- added support for different Qt wrappers
- renamed run-gui.py to easyleed.pyw
- added setup.py to allow easier installation


Version 2.0
------------

(NF): 
- New energy slider for fast scrolling over opened frames.
- A “custom energy button” is added to move to a particular energy framework.
- Integration windows (when present) are tracked with the energy slider.
- Redesigned Set Parameters panel.
- New entry in Set Parameters panel for size of integration circle.
- Size of default intensity integration circle can now be restored with Default button in Set Parameters
- Set Preference panel is always visible (i.e. can be accessed with no images loaded).
- Added "Apply" button in Set Preference, so that settings can be applied without closing the Set Preference panel. 
- Intensity files now have an extra tag in the filename
  * _bs.int: if the intensities were extracted with background subtraction.
  * _no-bs.int: if the intensities were not extracted with background subtraction.
- Added option to display I(E) spectra during acquisition (live plotting).
- Removed Plotting option panel (no longer needed). 
- Average intensities can be now plotted “on the fly” using a checkbox in the Plot.
- Smoothed (cubic spline) average intensities can be now plotted using a checkbox in the Plot.
  * Smoothing parameters act “live” on the plot (just type and press Enter, the plot is automatically updated).
- Average and smoothed averages can be saved into their own intensity files.
- Improved control over clearing plots: there is now a dedicated button in Plot.
- Added “Stop” button to stop acquisition (somehow missing). 
- Running an acquisition without any spot selected is prevented. 
- Added ability to take screenshots from menu (including integration windows and energy in filename).
- Moved buttons “next, previous” close to the slider.
- Added ability to acquire I(frame) - fix energy acquisitions.
- Saving and loading custom settings now works properly.
- Location of the integration windows can be saved and reloaded.
- Location of the center of the screen can be saved and reloaded.
- Hovering over integration windows shows the windows number for rapid identification of corresponding curve.
- Legend can be displayed in plot with reference to the integration window.
- Introduced toolbar in plotting window.
- Reorganized position of windows/panels to avoid overlapping.
- New About Box.
- Restored working Help (redirects to main website - User Manual). 
- Extensive optimization of user workflow.
- Several bug fixes and optimization.

API:
- New loader.goto(energy): load image at specified energy.
- New loader.energySteps(energy): get # frame steps for custom beam energy.


(AM):
- added ability to set center by user
- energy label now displayed atop of the image
- plotting refactored (now faster)
- new config parameter fitRegionFactor to set size of search region

Changes in  defaults:
- default size of integration window 10 --> 20
- Tracking input precision 5 --> 2
- Tracking process noise in position 0.04 --> 0.1
